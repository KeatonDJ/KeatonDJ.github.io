<h1>Description</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our project will be a blackjack game and training application. &nbsp;The player will be able to join a lobby to play against other players in real time or play against a computer. &nbsp;There is also a training aspect where it will tell you if you made the correct or incorrect decision in real time.&nbsp; We will also have other helpful bits of information like tips/tricks and an odds table for decision making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be using Java and XML to run the client side of our application. &nbsp;Spring Framework will be our server side language and we will be using mySQL for Database management.</span></p>
<h1>Languages/Platforms/Libraries</h1>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Spring</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Android Studios</li>
</ul>
<h1>Large/Complex</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of all of the features we plan to implement in Twenty One:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Android mobile card game Twenty One (Blackjack)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A playable AI</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A training feature that helps new players understand the game</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support at least 2-player multiplayer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User sign-in to see prior game scores, win/loss rates, etc</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating the game Twenty One is going to take up most of our time as it is the main component to our project. We will need to have images for all of the cards along with the logic for Blackjack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this, there needs to be an AI Computer that can play with the user. We were thinking that the AI would be the dealer and not be very smart. If needed, we will add a difficulty feature for the AI Computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, our team plans to add a statistic system that will display the odds of hitting or staying for each move. We feel this could help with newer players and add more info that can help the user decide what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, the multiplayer is going to allow for at least 2 players to play against each other. Our ultimate goal is to support 4-player multiplayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team is going to use Android Studio to create Twenty One, and only one group member has experience using it.. However, none of us have created a mobile app that includes a server-side and database. We all know how to code in Java, but haven&rsquo;t used Java Spring before to handle server-side interactions. As for MySQL, no one has experience using it or how to handle the database.</span></p>
