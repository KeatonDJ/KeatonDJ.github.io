						<span class="text-primary">TwentyOne</span>
					</h1>
					<div class="mb-5">This project is an android app based on the casino game Blackjack developed in ComS 309 at ISU. This project is intended to be made in 4 development cycles. Each cycle is as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>First: This first demo covered the project proposal and each group members roles.</li>
							<li>Second: The second demo required the app to have "round trip" communication. Client to Server, Server to Database, Database to Server, Server to Client.</li>
							<li>Third: This demo's requirements were that the game's core features should be implemented. In our case this included signing in, joining a lobby, starting a game, playing the game, and finishing the game.</li>
							<li>Fourth: The final demo will present the secondary features of the app. In this case it will be card backs, player preferences, tuning of the UI, and a chatting feature.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p class="mb-5"><a href="309Proposal.html">Class Project Proposal</a> (Bare html page)</p>

					<h3>What is TwentyOne</h3>
					<p>TwentyOne is the app my three group members and I have been developing. It is an android app with a client built in android studio and a backend made on the Spring Framework with integration to a mySQL server. The server was supplied and hosted by Iowa State University.</p>
					
					<h2>First Project Iteration</h2>
					<p class = "mb-0">The following images are taken from the first iteration of TwentyOne.</p>

					</p>
					<h3>Issues and concerns with first iteration.</h3>
					<p>For this first demo we ran into a few issues. The big problems we worked to address in the next demo were as follows:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Lobby ready up page does not update regularly</li>
						<li>Refresh button was temporarily added until we can get the game to update automatically</li>
						<li>Mysterious crash occurs when attempting to join lobby on Android 8.1.0 OREO</li>
						<li>Player 3 and 4 should not show when there are only two players in the game</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We plan to solve these issues with the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Have the lobby screen update regularly or implement web sockets that tell other players when a player is ready</li>
						<li>Have the game screen update by using web sockets. Whenever someone hits or stays they send a message to other players</li>
						<li>Debug the code looking for what error is being thrown when attempting to access lobby screen</li>
						<li>Double check the multiplayer screen code for a simple error since player 4 disappears when there are only 3 players.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h2>gitlab CI/CD implementation</h2>
					<p>CI/CD implementation for our project allows for seamless integration and 100% server uptime after each addition.<br />
					The following are the stages of the pipeline:</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Maven Build - Builds the Spring Boot project.</li>
					<li>Maven Test - Tests the built project.</li>
					<li>Autodeploy - Builds the Spring Boot project and outputs a jar. (see below for more information)</li>
					<li>Android Build - Builds the Android Project and adds the APK to the artifacts.</li>
					<li>Android Test - Tests the Android Project.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h3>Autodeploy</h3>
					<p>In stage 3 of the pipeline a jar is produced and moved to a target folder. After the jar is moved, a service I created on the redhat server executes which runs the jar.</p>
					<p>Example of recent pipeline</p>

					<div class="subheading mb-5">This project is an embedded systems project created for CprE 288 at ISU</div>
					<p class="mb-5">This project was assigned in my first embedded systems course at ISU. We were tasked with using each component we used throughout lab to navigate a course with tall thick objects (stalagmite), short objects (boulders), missing floor tiles (craters), and finally 4 thin pylons signifying the finish zone.</p>
					<p><a href = "http://class.ece.iastate.edu/cpre288/labs/Project/project_description_s17.pdf">Project Description</a> (found on the CprE 288 - Embedded Systems <a href = "http://class.ece.iastate.edu/cpre288/lab.asp">course website</a>)</p>
					<p>The microcontroller we used was the Tivaâ„¢ TM4C123GH6PM</p>
					<p class = "mb-0">List of sensors/components</p>
					<ul>
						<li>LCD Display</li>
						<li>iRobat Open Interface (Roomba Create)</li>
						<li>Push Buttons</li>
						<li>Clocks, Timers, Interupts</li>
						<li>WiFi communications (provided by additional WiFi board made by ETG at ISU)</li>
						<li>ADC for IR object width tracking</li>
						<li>PING))) Sensor for object distance tracking</li>
						<li>PWM timer mode for Servo use</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Mars Rover - Object detection</h3>
					<div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i6QayVtvsXU" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
					<p>In this portion of the project we were tasked with detecting objects using an IR sensor and PING))) sensor attached to a servo. To accomplish this I had to servo position increment while taking sonar and IR readings. The reason for both is that the sensors we used were good at specific things. The IR sensor was really good at detecting at what angles there was an object and the sonar sensor was really good at reading the distance of that object.</p>
					<p>After gathering both data sets (180 values for each sensor), we wrote a program that looked at the IR sensor for when it saw a drop in the average distance. We then checked the distance data from the PING))) sensor and calculated how far away it was.</p>
					<p>Finally, we needed to know how wide the object was. This was accomplished by using the distance value and the angles that this object was present. With this information we could then use the equation</p>
					<p><em>tan(objectAngle/2) = 2*width / distance</em></p>
					<p>to calculate the width of that object by solving for width. Once the program was finished with it's calculations it points at the object that was smallest.</p>
					<p><img class = "myImg" src="img/RoverCalculations.png"  width = "580" height = "350" alt = "Distance and Width Measurements" /></p>
					<h3>Mars Rover - Final Design</h3>
					<p>For the final demonstration of this project my group was placed in at an isolated computer blind to the testing field. This field was littered with obstacles, holes, and 4 goal posts which we needed to drive our rover into.</p>
					<p>The majority of the work for this project was in the data collection. The IR sensor required the implementation of an ADC function. The servo required a timer in PWM configuration so I could feed it specific values that align with specific angles. The iRobat came with a handy Open Interface that allowed for easy movement controls. Finally we needed WiFi communication to send the bot commands. Each of these programs were written from scratch in C.</p>

					<p>I'm currently learning react by creating various components: <a href="https://github.com/KeatonDJ/learningReact">Github Link</a></p>
					<p>Primarily I have completed a simple alarm clock app that alerts the user when the chosen alarm time matches the current time.</p>
						<h2>Alarm Clock: <a href="https://keatondj.github.io/KeatonDJReact">Try Me!</a></h2>
						<h3>First iteration:</h3>
						<p class = "mt-5 mb-0"><img class = "myImg" src = "img/App.png" alt = "React App Image" /></p>
						<p>Currently the features I have implemented are:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Alerts user when current time == alarm time</li>
							<li>Can change current timezone by selecting the Hr+ or Hr- buttons</li>
							<li>Can change alarm time by selecting the Hr+ and Min+ buttons</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Features I would like to implement</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Selecting AM/PM</li>
							<li>Making format more appealing</li>
							<li>Add alarm noise</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Current Bugs (Both bugs are caused by how I convert 24 hrs to 12 hr format and handle timezone change)</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Time does not display the proper time by default.</li>
							<li>Both current time buttons occasionally decrement when they are supposed to increment. (And vise versa)</li>
						</ol>

						<div class="subheading">What I am learning</div>
						<h3>React JS</h3>
						<p>My current progress on learning ReactJS is listed <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#reactjs">above</a>.</p>
						<h3>Git</h3>
						<p>Until this year I never fully understood nor properly used Git. However, this year I made it a point to get more familiar with what git was and how to use it. Specifically, I wanted to learn using git bash since using commands will give me more control and versatility than a client would.</p>
						<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
						<p>Until last year I didn't really know what bootstrap was, nor how to fully utilize it in front-end development. I have started using it in this website as well as my reactJS project.</p>
						<div class="subheading">What I want to learn</div>
						<h3>More JS</h3>
						<p>This includes various frameworks/packages that I currently don't have much experience. AngularJS and NodeJS</p>
						<h3>Python</h3>
						<p>I have seen more of my classmates each semester start picking up python. From what I've observed it may be a very versatile language to add to my toolkit</p>
